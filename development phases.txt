install openshot/mmex from a different source

- /usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf use SVG floflis logotype

- possible solution to issues: don't detect ISO mode at boot, but after logon. So, run the firstlogon anyway and differ functions if ISO or installation
- fix Ubiquity appearing after os is installed (possibly related with Core's firstboot running on ISO)
possible workaround: disable firstboot on both Core/Soil and re-enable slowly

Floflis Central: manage applets and desklets; introduce zombie applets and desklets! (existing spices that are changed/managed by another)

export data of nft bg extension

UniStore and Central will support Cinnamon extensions, desklets and applets; including zombie spices.
untitled lib will be used in the zombie spices editor; so it creates a untitled spice to be edited then renamed/packaged

example of zombie desklets: "Command result desklet" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie applets: "Bash Sensors" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie extensions: "Watermark" forks as "NFTmark" and "Buildmark"
When Floflis Central identifies you are adding a spice, its pre-set data overwrites.

implement Web3Updater (with branches support, and Floflis branch is of its preview builds before it upgrades into stable branch - also, upgrading from Floflis 19 to an upgrade also changes its branch)

Web3Updater if arm*/riscv64: use rust-ipfs

attempt 40: apt-on-ipfs

attempt 41:

frst bld

import geth seed on ethereal
user profile from CLI

attempt 42: Plugz build normal and lite versions of Floflis DNA

attempt 43:

support Ledger hardware wallet when creating/importing ETH address
support migrating to Ledger
annotate planned support for Trezor and Keycard

attempt 44:

After ETH address is created/imported, the first login will be required. Signing the login message with date/nonce, this msg is sent to Floflis srv using POST request, and it sends back that user is logged.

Floflis Sync: public (git config) and private (Firedoge tabs/history/addon list/bookmarks) data.

Verify with sybil, send this request, srv registers in profile, and sends back that user is verified

after logging with ETH address and signing this login, will start syncing things such as "git config --global user.name" and "git config --global user.email"

attempt 45:

UI:
- First logon wizard
- Ask which size use for font, size for taskbar icons, etc (know age)
- Mouse course (offer achivement badges and FLOF)
- Typing course (read its data and offer achivement badges and FLOF)

attempt 46:

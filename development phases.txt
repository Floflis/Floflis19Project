steps:
builds:
32. examine what happens with Core's firstboot, logging everything
33. polishing: fix issues of previous build; 01 VCS, migrate to UbuntuCinnamonRemix
34. stable? install Firedoge (w blur effect and/or w/o NewTabHere) and others; NFC
35. upper layers
36. stable? web3updater at upper layers. install web3updater. e-ink mode/theme
37. stable? first build

attempt 32:
- up-to-date OS data (build, year)
- test if apps got installed/works
- new logo.png (which also means the Explore menu now have an new orb/icon)
- Ethereum icon in img/networks
- Symlink ".local/share/nu/history.txt" at Home for easier access
- Protect C2 common libs making them read-only
This avoids any accident if user forgets to use the pre-export in Floflis Packager
- remove sub-classes from .html5, .apps and .game mimetypes
This will avoid that other programs appears when going to open these files
- rename Floflis Central shortcut icon from "Floflis Central" to simply "Central"
This also improves the visibility of the icon
- add default avatar on Cinnamon if no avatar
- create /1/games folder
- create /1/html5 folder and install "Color Converter.html5"
- Update Ethereal to 2.7.4 (support to advanced parsing from smart-contracts; NFT parsing now possible)
- Update Nushell to 0.44.0 (now stable; but, still, provided as-is at your own choices/conscient risks)
- Introduce Nushell plugins
- Add floapps and its floflis-application-handler
- add Nu post-install
- Relative link for /1/Z-root
- Create /1/personal/data (prepare for the Personal Issues and Offline Peeper Poster apps)
- Load modules from a separate modules.sh file, and only if the modules folder is found
- fix getting source script from layers
- Important Updates and sanitize/organize files at Soil layer and its to-merge.sh
- Don't attempt to create folders/files that already exist
- install Floflis icons from git
- New generic avatar

- Don't attempt to move folders/files that aren't there anymore

-
Issues that may appear in this build:
- /home/${flouser}/.face symlink overwritting /usr/share/cinnamon/faces/user-generic.png when updating avatar

- soil's to-merge_firstlogon.sh don't install starship from the Internet, but from locally
- fix issue of Term colors not installed; same for Nushell

- Electron apps still not working

fix floapps installer

If Cubic mode, don't ask before installing important programs such as git (also git lfs)
Soil: don't install autoconf elinks ceni gdebi udftools nodejs

- possible solution to issues: don't detect ISO mode at boot, but after logon. So, run the firstlogon anyway and differ functions if ISO or installation
- fix Ubiquity appearing after os is installed (possibly related with Core's firstboot running on ISO)
possible workaround: disable firstboot on both Core/Soil and re-enable slowly

up-to-date OS data (build)

if required: put "telemetry" in firstboot, into a log file so we can understand what happen at boot. remove functions that are potentially interfering in Desktop/ubiquity.desktop

organize Eleganse-Floflis.tar.gz, Adapta.tar.gz, Adapta-Nokto.tar.gz at own folder at include/

- update the settings for all extensions/applets

Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix
- detect, differ from normal ubuntu
- rework Floflis Yaru icon theme, symlink all dupliced, support to Cinnamon Remix/Ubuntu 22 colors in folders
- replace gnome 2048 for .apps version, if floapps is installed (floapps require node.js)

superProductivity pre-installed

-zmb applets/desklets/extensions (these special spices depends on their own bash script. they come pre-loaded with their settings)
- Central lists spices (integrated with UniStore to permit downloads, on next builds)

Floflis Central: manage applets and desklets; introduce zombie applets and desklets! (existing spices that are changed/managed by another)

export data of nft bg extension

UniStore and Central will support Cinnamon extensions, desklets and applets; including zombie spices.
untitled lib will be used in the zombie spices editor; so it creates a untitled spice to be edited then renamed/packaged

example of zombie desklets: "Command result desklet" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie applets: "Bash Sensors" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie extensions: "Watermark" forks as "NFTmark" and "Buildmark"
When Floflis Central identifies you are adding a spice, its pre-set data overwrites.

attempt 36:

frst bld

implement Web3Updater (with branches support, and Floflis branch is of its preview builds before it upgrades into stable branch - also, upgrading from Floflis 19 to an upgrade also changes its branch)

Web3Updater if arm*/riscv64: use rust-ipfs

attempt 37: apt-on-ipfs

attempt 38:

import geth seed on ethereal
user profile from CLI

attempt 39: Plugz build normal and lite versions of Floflis DNA

attempt 40:

support Ledger hardware wallet when creating/importing ETH address
support migrating to Ledger
annotate planned support for Trezor and Keycard

attempt 41:

After ETH address is created/imported, the first login will be required. Signing the login message with date/nonce, this msg is sent to Floflis srv using POST request, and it sends back that user is logged.

Floflis Sync: public (git config) and private (Firedoge tabs/history/addon list/bookmarks) data.

Verify with sybil, send this request, srv registers in profile, and sends back that user is verified

after logging with ETH address and signing this login, will start syncing things such as "git config --global user.name" and "git config --global user.email"

attempt 42:

UI:
- First logon wizard
- Ask which size use for font, size for taskbar icons, etc (know age)
- Mouse course (offer achivement badges and FLOF)
- Typing course (read its data and offer achivement badges and FLOF)

attempt 43:

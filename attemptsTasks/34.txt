- floflis-packager c2 projects will have a file containing git files for c2export, HTML and scripts (FMWK2C2 will be the template)
- FLIC installs and opens cbc
- firedoge working install

- Look at all from-git Floflis dependencies, and init.sh on all
- All Floflis layers should take use of init.sh
- Floflis DNA build lite or normal (without depending on Plugz to be launched first)
- Floflis layers postinstall.sh which can be used by UniOS

- init.sh (with webpresent) in dss, floflis and its include/ git scripts

rewriteup of Floflis install scripts:
detect cubic mode and confirm /home have no subfolder.
then know what to install at cubic or at firstlogon from live ISO!
take a look at these leftovers: /media/daniella/Main Linux/home

include/img/Pictures/Phabulous Pabllo Vittar 💞.jpeg
install /home/daniella/Templates

floflis first logon:
- copy clock applet settings
- copy weather applet settings
- copy showdesktop applet settings
- remove cinnamon's own menu and install that menu that supports emojis
- temporarily disable setting "Floflis" as default icons, set "Yaru-cinnamon" instead
- temporarily disable "Adapta" as default app theme, set "Yaru-cinnamon-dark" instead
- temporarily disable "Eleganse-Floflis" as desktop theme, set "Yaru-cinnamon-dark" instead
- install include-firstlogon/home-daniella-Templates

fl fix /home/~/.nu_history, now pointing to .config/nushell/history.txt

new tree folder structure /home/daniella/Desktop/fl tree
then work on this: /media/daniella/78CFABD670741B23/floflis-backup-sync, /media/daniella/Main Linux/1/personal/data

up-to-date OS info in config

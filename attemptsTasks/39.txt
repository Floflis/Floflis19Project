You are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX. Note that many verbs only install 32-bit versions of packages. If you encounter problems, please retest in a clean 32-bit WINEPREFIX before reporting a bug.

- buildmark and nftmark are being installed but not installing their dependence: watermark
- floflis ubiquity not appearing buttons (this is because bullet and arrows are root only? gs.png and photos.png are also root, but gs.png is still visible); photos slide have no img

smaller versions of floflisCentral icon

dont anymore support importing ETH privkey, but only generating a floflis-exclusive address
-
reform on Floflis' Web3 things; make it optional, for the web3-personality-pack. Also never ask for privatekey, only enable floflis-exclusive address (and tell its not much safe) and walletconnect through frame
-
Floflis propose to split assets by using multiple wallets (include option to import ronin address)

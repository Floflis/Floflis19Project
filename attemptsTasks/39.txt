Floflis Central: support being opened with a flag (useful for the Explore menu opening Floflis Central directly in the "More Settings" tab
Floflis Central basic redesign in the vertical menu, also not using capital letters for menu items
Floflis Central updated "Open classical settings" button in the "More settings" tab
Floflis Central Profile>Wallet tab: replace "ETH" by "Gas" and display breakdown of blockchains' native tokens; then right after this item, display "Stablecoins" then its breakdown
Floflis Central fix the "Play with" tab's items. display OBS/supertux/audacity/etcher item only if it is detected installed
Floflis Central deactivate "Lockscreen" card (but add placeholder img) and "Change both at once" in the Personalization tab
Floflis Central Personalization>change look-and-feel tab: dark theme activated by default. when deactivated, change theme to yaru-cinnamon light
Floflis Central enable to set Profile/Inventory/Metaverse Stuff/Paintings as NFT desktop background
Floflis Central turn Home+About tab's "up-to-date" into linkish to open the Update tab, which will tell implemented soon

customShortcuts: use sed instead of overwritting; use variables to deduplicate text/functions

open /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Branding/ubiquity-slideshow/Tasks.txt (and New screenshot for photos.png (wider), New screenshot for music.png)

- installer will tell less details, by using .log files (start with Floflis Icons)!
- git repos as .webpresent files (webpresent app have to identify)

Floflis' ~/Templates files owned by root

new switch workspace sound
new logout sound

on every logon, Floflis Update will update git dependencies (pull + run install.sh) if they dont have w3u files. this behavior will be shown in Floflis Central. --update flag will open Central on this tab; also will have a shortcut just as frnds

anbox

Floflis firstlogon wait for Floflis Sync/Backup before running tasks for SSH/IPFS ID

mkdocs and README.md abt Webpresent: webpresent means a file was uploaded, and weborigin means a file was downloaded. naming weborigin or webpresent doesn't alter how webpresent works, but only serves as semantic. how to format google drive. google drive, ipfs and git supported, and wget for all other sites.
mkdocs add soon info abt witchlink files
fl mkdocs dev tell about zombie spices
fl mkdocs updt abt tree folder structure

- Framework4C2 merge with FMWK r3
- Framework4C2 uses webpresent to get git out of c2export/HTML+scripts
- Framework4C2 detecting if HTML dont exist/is empty, then displaying error. Also enable apps to tell they can run only in specific platforms.
- the foundation for Framework4C2 at spawning new app with c2export/HTML+scripts, and floflis-packager recognizing a config file

fl layers update all readme.mds

filepeace's handler for sum files (gipfs will be a plugin to handle .cid files)
-
HTML5Player as mime default app for .html5 files (these files can either be texty or .tar.gz, and updt abt this on Floflis Docs Dev)
-
floapps use reverse domain on application/package IDs
fl install central in /1/apps/eth.floflis.central
floapps run post-install.sh or pre-install.sh when installing a .apps or .game, but user will have to open it on notepad and review first! or better: floflis-packager will offer to include a bash "binary" to be installed in /usr/bin, .desktop shortcuts and icons (svg for linux and png for electron)
-
pre-installed HTML5 apps (also the HTML5Apps Platform)!

- FLIC installs and opens cbc


better method for renaming shortcuts; don't overwrite a whole file but a part of it

- floflis-packager c2 projects will have a file containing git files for c2export, HTML and scripts (FMWK2C2 will be the template)

- Look at all from-git Floflis dependencies, and init.sh on all
- All Floflis layers should take use of init.sh (also for UniOS)
- Floflis DNA build lite or normal (without depending on Plugz to be launched first)
- Floflis layers postinstall.sh which can be used by UniOS

firstlogon open wizard, then ask user to add the ethgas applet/desklet (etherean-personality-pack assigned)


find ". /usr/lib/floflis/./config" in Core and Soil's installers, then thanks to functions move them to Floflis' DNA installer

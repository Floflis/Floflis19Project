cryptovoxels svg icon

install openshot/mmex from a different source

- /usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf use SVG floflis logotype

- possible solution to issues: don't detect ISO mode at boot, but after logon. So, run the firstlogon anyway and differ functions if ISO or installation
- fix Ubiquity appearing after os is installed (possibly related with Core's firstboot running on ISO)
possible workaround: disable firstboot on both Core/Soil and re-enable slowly

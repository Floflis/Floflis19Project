pair Floflis' cinnamon settings with Cinnamobile's settings

ask to install winapps at firstlogon, and it will require Internet (be it target user or it technicial for customer

/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/cinnamon-patch

firstlogon first ask if Internet is connected before proceeding.

ISO size reduction measures:

firstlogon edge question: install edge from ms repo instead of from deb
sudo apt install microsoft-edge-stable, https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge/
?, https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/ms-teams/
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/release

fix cinnamon due-applet startup issue (buildmark and nftmark not compatible with current version of cinnamon; said that bc their host extension isn't being installed)

taskbar search applet isn't loading its defaults

/usr/share/ubiquity-slideshow is still owned by root

ubiquity-slideshow: misalignment in the taskbar img; it should be separated. music img is too big. central slide displays off icon at header. Help & Support slide: dont mention "Dock", but Explore menu.

pin the Help app on taskbar

"The Ubuntu Cinnamon daily build I tried lacks a web browser, and The GIMP is set as the default image viewer (!) which feels a little odd given that both gThumb (which Linux Mint’s Pix is based on) and GNOME’s Photos are included."

gedit as the default program for webpresent files? they should be considered text files

- Cubic pjs folder
- Full, Basic (w/o WINE) and Lite versions
- generate build number automatically (year, month, add number)
- flic.conf: src ISOs, etc
- Automate DNA "config", cubic.conf and desktop watermark
- export folders, with all of the builds/attempts
- run "cubic --verbose", then export to build folder's cubic.html
- support to Snap seeding!
- support to generate the latest kernel, signed!
- support to Floflis forks such as UniOS

rmv previous kernel
Cleanup old kernel versions
Find a list of all currently installed kernel versions. An easy way to do this is to list the config files in the /boot folder:
-
ls -r /boot/config-*
-
This will provide a list. For each instance make a note of that version number. Then, list all linux packages:
-
dpkg --list | grep -i "linux-"
-
Then purge all the packages with old version numbers. IconsPage/warning.png Do not purge packages with the most current kernel number:
-
apt-get purge <packages>
-
For example:
-
apt-get purge linux-headers-5.15.0-43 linux-headers-5.15.0-43-generic linux-image-5.15.0-43-generic linux-modules-5.15.0-43-generic linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-43-generic

don't anymore run npm install on floapps (test if Central still work)
- dock/undock: install floapps also at Cubic side, then on next build attempt don't install on firstlogon anymore. with that, test if Floflis Central with NodeJS can come with the ISO (which is the ideal)

Before exiting chroot

Cleanup old kernel versions
Find a list of all currently installed kernel versions. An easy way to do this is to list the config files in the /boot folder:

ls -r /boot/config-*

This will provide a list. For each instance make a note of that version number. Then, list all linux packages:

dpkg --list | grep -i "linux-"

Then purge all the packages with old version numbers. IconsPage/warning.png Do not purge packages with the most current kernel number:

apt-get purge <packages>

For example:

apt-get purge linux-headers-5.15.0-43 linux-headers-5.15.0-43-generic linux-image-5.15.0-43-generic linux-modules-5.15.0-43-generic linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-43-generic

but so for normal/dark/light, now follow this tip by Joshua Peisach:
https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru/blob/master/create-new-variant.md

"The Ubuntu Cinnamon daily build I tried lacks a web browser, and The GIMP is set as the default image viewer (!) which feels a little odd given that both gThumb (which Linux Mintâ€™s Pix is based on) and GNOMEâ€™s Photos are included."

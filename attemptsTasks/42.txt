<---- BUG


switch cinnamon spice defaults from /home/daniella/.cinnamon/configs to /home/daniella/.config/cinnamon/spices

use /usr/share/applications/org.kde.kolourpaint.desktop instead of snap one

firstboot: change distro pretty-name and others such as ubuntu-logo (now floflis-logo). version now will include build and attempt
lsb-release
os-release
-
updt distro pretty-name to "Floflis 19" (but get it from config/json) /etc/os-release
/etc/os-release (change pretty_name+home_url+bug_report_url, prepare for changing logo and others)

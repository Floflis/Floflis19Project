Floflis new sounds https://pastebin.com/JJgBSgN5

install spices' default settings in a permanent place, and install it every time Cinnamobile run

run wine config at user firstlogon

fix pooltogether icon

- make Central smarter (such as not bugging when username JSON not found), and move imgs/assets to the HTML repo (FrameworkJS template will follow this example)
- dock/undock: install floapps also at Cubic side, then on next build attempt don't install on firstlogon anymore. with that, test if Floflis Central with NodeJS can come with the ISO (which is the ideal)
- upgrade floapps Node template + AppPlayer to the latest version possible

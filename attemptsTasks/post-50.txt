- fix Ubiquity appearing after os is installed (possibly related with Core's firstboot running on ISO)
possible workaround: disable firstboot on both Core/Soil and re-enable slowly

Floflis Central: manage applets and desklets; introduce zombie applets and desklets! (existing spices that are changed/managed by another)

export data of nft bg extension

UniStore and Central will support Cinnamon extensions, desklets and applets; including zombie spices.
untitled lib will be used in the zombie spices editor; so it creates a untitled spice to be edited then renamed/packaged

example of zombie desklets: "Command result desklet" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie applets: "Bash Sensors" fork as "ETHGas"
example of zombie extensions: "Watermark" forks as "NFTmark" and "Buildmark"
When Floflis Central identifies you are adding a spice, its pre-set data overwrites.

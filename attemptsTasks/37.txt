fl fixer: run "w" and detect current display, then run "cinnamon --replace --display=:{number-id}"; document this on --help

soil's to-merge:

list default desktop background at .xml file /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/img/Backgrounds/floflis-backgrounds.xml

-? fix issue of repeated symlink and wrong login sound /usr/share/sounds/Yaru/stereo /usr/share/sounds/Yaru/stereo/ubuntu
-
/home/daniella/Desktop/fl sounds
-
pastebin alarm
-
fix /1/sounds /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/sounds (ogg/oga issue)
move /1/sounds to /1/Floflis/system
/1/Floflis/system/os.json up-to-date build info and, now add distrobase
replace alarm clock and logoff sounds /home/daniella/Desktop/fl sounds

Floflis firstlogon wait for Floflis Sync/Backup before running tasks for SSH/IPFS ID
firstlogon wizard: ask if user want Explore menu label. and seconds in calendar applet; also if user want the "/" format

register IPFS ID
jq -r '.Identity.PeerID' /home/daniella/.ipfs/config
-
Floflis Central display IPFS ID
/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/Central/c2export/scripts/abis: fix hardlink, use repo
new screenshots for Central

/media/daniella/Seagate Expansion Drive/floflis-backup-sync/full/daniella/Desktop/fl/fl voxels icons timeline/3

- work at Central supporting Ronin https://explorer.roninchain.com/address/ronin:e51b58bb6733dabcd86050e13e77f61f5ea00664 https://docs.roninchain.com/docs/intro/mainnet https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/weth https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/usd-coin https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/smooth-love-potion https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/axie-infinity)

-? another temporary measure to fix issues: deactivate "hide nu-script-handler and floflis-application-handler from displaying"

turn /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/floapps/include/Floflis_libs_game-engines_c2.tar.gz into a repo/folder

install /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Utilities/scripts-common

- firstboot runs firstboot-userstasks (this supports running layers), which echoes a log that will be read+rm by firstlogon. this prevents users from closing essential settings

- bug: gimp is being the default app for opening images

replace Ubuntu's 2048 by Floflis Pull's own (but also come with script that installs its icon)
/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.TwentyFortyEight.desktop
/media/daniella/B/git/FloflisPull/2048

to-merge.sh: move "Installing Floflis Central..." functions to include/HTML5Apps/central/install.sh (also move central.apps)

mkdocs and README.md abt Webpresent: webpresent means a file was uploaded, and weborigin means a file was downloaded. naming weborigin or webpresent doesn't alter how webpresent works, but only serves as semantic. how to format google drive. google drive, ipfs and git supported, and wget for all other sites.
mkdocs add soon info abt witchlink files
fl mkdocs dev tell about zombie spices
fl mkdocs updt abt tree folder structure

- Framework4C2 merge with FMWK r3
- Framework4C2 uses webpresent to get git out of c2export/HTML+scripts
- Framework4C2 detecting if HTML dont exist/is empty, then displaying error. Also enable apps to tell they can run only in specific platforms.
- the foundation for Framework4C2 at spawning new app with c2export/HTML+scripts, and floflis-packager recognizing a config file

fl layers update all readme.mds

filepeace's handler for sum files (gipfs will be a plugin to handle .cid files)
-
HTML5Player as mime default app for .html5 files (these files can either be texty or .tar.gz, and updt abt this on Floflis Docs Dev)
-
floapps use reverse domain on application/package IDs
fl install central in /1/apps/eth.floflis.central
floapps run post-install.sh or pre-install.sh when installing a .apps or .game, but user will have to open it on notepad and review first! or better: floflis-packager will offer to include a bash "binary" to be installed in /usr/bin, .desktop shortcuts and icons (svg for linux and png for electron)
-
pre-installed HTML5 apps (also the HTML5Apps Platform)!

- FLIC installs and opens cbc

own repo for Floflis weblink apps /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Utilities/WeblinkApps
-
fl rename shortcut to "Character Map" (add to missing crowdin list)
better method for renaming shortcuts; don't overwrite a whole file but a part of it
-
- rename shortcuts as "shortcuts" instead of "icons"
- fix: duplicate entry for Music and Rythmbox
- separate script to install Internet shortcuts, and another to install Floflis' custom shortcuts

- floflis-packager c2 projects will have a file containing git files for c2export, HTML and scripts (FMWK2C2 will be the template)

- Look at all from-git Floflis dependencies, and init.sh on all
- All Floflis layers should take use of init.sh (also for UniOS)
- Floflis DNA build lite or normal (without depending on Plugz to be launched first)
- Floflis layers postinstall.sh which can be used by UniOS

firstlogon open wizard, then ask user to add the ethgas applet/desklet (etherean-personality-pack assigned)


find ". /usr/lib/floflis/./config" in Core and Soil's installers, then thanks to functions move them to Floflis' DNA installer

use cyan color on floflis logos, do the same in default-testpage.pdf (also update in its press site)

fl both the ISO's and user's first logon will have the Firedoge install (firedoge install will detect if ISO user or normal user, and install will only open firedoge when ISO logged)

new network icons, for OP, Arbitrum and zSync (reflect these changes in central and its listed networks)
new renamed icon for Gnosis Chain (reflect these changes in central)

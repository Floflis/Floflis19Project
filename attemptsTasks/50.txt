Floverse app will have shortcuts for Cryptovoxels, Decentraland and TheSandbox. Also for Minetest. Minecraft shortcut will ask to install it. Also Floflis Places.
Floflis Places will have two tabs after opened by Floverse: "Shortcuts" and "Metaverse"; initially only Shortcuts available, such as Pooltogethers lottery. Floflis Shortcuts will be entirely replaced by the Floverse app!
-
- replace gnome 2048 for .apps version, if floapps is installed (floapps require node.js)
-
Communicator will have shortcuts for Pidgin/Ferdi/others (and Telegram desktop if it is found installed)


before asking to create SSH and IPFS ID, check for flo-bkp-sync

customShortcuts: use sed instead of overwritting; use variables to deduplicate text/functions

open /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Branding/ubiquity-slideshow/Tasks.txt (and New screenshot for photos.png (wider))

- installer will tell less details, by using .log files (start with Floflis Icons)!
- git repos as .webpresent files (webpresent app have to identify)

Floflis' ~/Templates files owned by root

on every logon, Floflis Update will update git dependencies (pull + run install.sh) if they dont have w3u files. this behavior will be shown in Floflis Central. --update flag will open Central on this tab; also will have a shortcut just as frnds

multiaddress: import hardware wallet, ronin and argent

MS Teams with custom shortcut+icon
firstlogon: ask user to confirm autostart apps

shared location settings for gnomeMaps, gnomeWeather and Weather applet/desklet

microsoflis fledge package, that installs MS Edge with Firedoge's addons (with even the new tab?)

Bing as default search engine for both CinnVIIStarkMenu, Cinnamenu and menu@cinnamon.org

Firedoge: Bing as default search engine
Firedoge: tell that DogeAds are coming

turn /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/floapps/include/Floflis_libs_game-engines_c2.tar.gz into a repo/folder

- firstboot runs firstboot-userstasks (this supports running layers), which echoes a log that will be read+rm by firstlogon. this prevents users from closing essential settings

-? sudo apt install evolution

deep integration with gnome online accounts on next builds


fl fixer: run "w" and detect current display, then run "cinnamon --replace --display=:{number-id}"; document this on --help

Floflis firstlogon wait for Floflis Sync/Backup before running tasks for SSH/IPFS ID
firstlogon wizard: ask if user want Explore menu label. and seconds in calendar applet; also if user want the "/" format. ask if user want the water applet to display in C or F and if want to display details such as "Clouds"


mkdocs and README.md abt Webpresent: webpresent means a file was uploaded, and weborigin means a file was downloaded. naming weborigin or webpresent doesn't alter how webpresent works, but only serves as semantic. how to format google drive. google drive, ipfs and git supported, and wget for all other sites.
mkdocs add soon info abt witchlink files
fl mkdocs dev tell about zombie spices
fl mkdocs updt abt tree folder structure

fl layers update all readme.mds

- FLIC installs and opens cbc


firstlogon open wizard, then ask user to add the ethgas applet/desklet (etherean-personality-pack assigned)


find ". /usr/lib/floflis/./config" in Core and Soil's installers, then thanks to functions move them to Floflis' DNA installer

- Look at all from-git Floflis dependencies, and init.sh on all
- All Floflis layers should take use of init.sh (also for UniOS)
- Floflis DNA build lite or normal (without depending on Plugz to be launched first)
- Floflis layers postinstall.sh which can be used by UniOS
-

- replace gnome 2048 for .apps version, if floapps is installed (floapps require node.js)
-
Communicator will have shortcuts for Pidgin/Ferdi/others (and Telegram desktop if it is found installed)


firstlogon questions:
ask to have label in Explore menu or not (default is not)

updated Yaru-cinnamon desktop themes, with hover effects
Floflis Central light/dark theme toggle (affects cinnamon theme)

firstlogon ask first questions

Floflis Central: organize functions in separate event-sheets
Floflis Central fix card hovering freeze, also attention to the ETHGas badge in topbar
Floflis Central frameless window with window buttons on topbar (inspiration by Framlr)
Floflis Central: support being opened with a flag (useful for the Explore menu opening Floflis Central directly in the "More Settings" tab
Floflis Central basic redesign in the vertical menu, also not using capital letters for menu items
Floflis Central updated "Open classical settings" button in the "More settings" tab
Floflis Central Profile>Wallet tab: replace "ETH" by "Gas" and display breakdown of blockchains' native tokens; then right after this item, display "Stablecoins" then its breakdown
Floflis Central fix the "Play with" tab's items. display OBS/supertux/audacity/etcher item only if it is detected installed
Floflis Central deactivate "Lockscreen" card (but add placeholder img) and "Change both at once" in the Personalization tab
Floflis Central Personalization>change look-and-feel tab: dark theme activated by default. when deactivated, change theme to yaru-cinnamon light
Floflis Central enable to set Profile/Inventory/Metaverse Stuff/Paintings as NFT desktop background
Floflis Central turn Home+About tab's "up-to-date" into linkish to open the Update tab, which will tell implemented soon

customShortcuts: use sed instead of overwritting; use variables to deduplicate text/functions

open /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Branding/ubiquity-slideshow/Tasks.txt (and New screenshot for photos.png (wider))

- installer will tell less details, by using .log files (start with Floflis Icons)!
- git repos as .webpresent files (webpresent app have to identify)

Floflis' ~/Templates files owned by root

on every logon, Floflis Update will update git dependencies (pull + run install.sh) if they dont have w3u files. this behavior will be shown in Floflis Central. --update flag will open Central on this tab; also will have a shortcut just as frnds

multiaddress: import hardware wallet, ronin and argent

add firedoge to cinnamon's sound applet as a player. but how to?

hone up these:
/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/floapps
/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/floflis-application-handler
/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Rust/nushell/nu-post-install

MS Teams with custom shortcut+icon
firstlogon: ask user to confirm autostart apps

shared location settings for gnomeMaps, gnomeWeather and Weather applet/desklet

microsoflis fledge package, that installs MS Edge with Firedoge's addons (with even the new tab?)

Bing as default search engine for both CinnVIIStarkMenu, Cinnamenu and menu@cinnamon.org

Firedoge: Bing as default search engine
Firedoge: tell that DogeAds are coming

- work at Central supporting Ronin https://explorer.roninchain.com/address/ronin:e51b58bb6733dabcd86050e13e77f61f5ea00664 https://docs.roninchain.com/docs/intro/mainnet https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/weth https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/usd-coin https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/smooth-love-potion https://www.coingecko.com/pt/moedas/axie-infinity)

turn /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/floapps/include/Floflis_libs_game-engines_c2.tar.gz into a repo/folder

- firstboot runs firstboot-userstasks (this supports running layers), which echoes a log that will be read+rm by firstlogon. this prevents users from closing essential settings


-? https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Documents
-? sudo apt install evolution

deep integration with gnome online accounts on next builds


fl fixer: run "w" and detect current display, then run "cinnamon --replace --display=:{number-id}"; document this on --help

Floflis firstlogon wait for Floflis Sync/Backup before running tasks for SSH/IPFS ID
firstlogon wizard: ask if user want Explore menu label. and seconds in calendar applet; also if user want the "/" format. ask if user want the water applet to display in C or F and if want to display details such as "Clouds"

register IPFS ID
jq -r '.Identity.PeerID' /home/daniella/.ipfs/config
-
Floflis Central display IPFS ID
/media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/HTML5/Central/c2export/scripts/abis: fix hardlink, use repo
new screenshots for Central


replace Ubuntu's 2048 by Floflis Pull's own (but also come with script that installs its icon)
/usr/share/applications/org.gnome.TwentyFortyEight.desktop
/media/daniella/B/git/FloflisPull/2048

mkdocs and README.md abt Webpresent: webpresent means a file was uploaded, and weborigin means a file was downloaded. naming weborigin or webpresent doesn't alter how webpresent works, but only serves as semantic. how to format google drive. google drive, ipfs and git supported, and wget for all other sites.
mkdocs add soon info abt witchlink files
fl mkdocs dev tell about zombie spices
fl mkdocs updt abt tree folder structure

fl layers update all readme.mds

- FLIC installs and opens cbc


better method for renaming shortcuts; don't overwrite a whole file but a part of it

firstlogon open wizard, then ask user to add the ethgas applet/desklet (etherean-personality-pack assigned)


find ". /usr/lib/floflis/./config" in Core and Soil's installers, then thanks to functions move them to Floflis' DNA installer

- Look at all from-git Floflis dependencies, and init.sh on all
- All Floflis layers should take use of init.sh (also for UniOS)
- Floflis DNA build lite or normal (without depending on Plugz to be launched first)
- Floflis layers postinstall.sh which can be used by UniOS
-
all floflis dependencies (git repos) using webpresent
make Floflis include/ in all layers reproducible
-
add .weborigin for /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/deb packages, /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/deb packages/hugo, /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/Terminal/nerdyfonts and /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/HTML5Apps

-
- floflis-packager c2 projects will have a file containing git files for c2export, HTML and scripts (FMWK2C2 will be the template)

filepeace's handler for sum files (gipfs will be a plugin to handle .cid files)
-
HTML5Player as mime default app for .html5 files (these files can either be texty or .tar.gz, and updt abt this on Floflis Docs Dev)
-
floapps use reverse domain on application/package IDs
fl install central in /1/apps/eth.floflis.central
floapps run post-install.sh or pre-install.sh when installing a .apps or .game, but user will have to open it on notepad and review first! or better: floflis-packager will offer to include a bash "binary" to be installed in /usr/bin, .desktop shortcuts and icons (svg for linux and png for electron)
-
pre-installed HTML5 apps (also the HTML5Apps Platform)!

- Framework4C2 merge with FMWK r3
- Framework4C2 uses webpresent to get git out of c2export/HTML+scripts
- Framework4C2 detecting if HTML dont exist/is empty, then displaying error. Also enable apps to tell they can run only in specific platforms.
- the foundation for Framework4C2 at spawning new app with c2export/HTML+scripts, and floflis-packager recognizing a config file


use cyan color on floflis logos, do the same in default-testpage.pdf (also reflect this update in its press site)

new network icons, for OP, Arbitrum and zSync (reflect these changes in central and its listed networks)

- restart my linux, test taskbar context, settings central and settings user avatar symlink

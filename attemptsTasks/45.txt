Floflis new sounds https://pastebin.com/JJgBSgN5

start moving some safe items for new tree structure /home/daniella/Desktop/fl/fl tree and then update mkdocs

Floflis Rust CLI tools https://pastebin.com/Tt912XAG, https://github.com/sts10/rust-command-line-utilities
-
install /media/daniella/B/git/Floflis/Utilities/scripts-common, but a fork from floflis with an install.sh (both /usr/bin and /usr/lib)

Installing installer's slideshow...
mv: cannot stat '/usr/share/ubiquity-slideshow/slides/icons/firefox.png': No such file or directory

fix installing wine-mono and dotnet45, which is requiring GUI confirmations

- install fantasque and fonts at boot instead of firstlogon (will require multipart Starshell)
add more apt -y if Cubic mode/flag

bug: buildmark@floflis having to be removed/re-added to work

"The Ubuntu Cinnamon daily build I tried lacks a web browser, and The GIMP is set as the default image viewer (!) which feels a little odd given that both gThumb (which Linux Mintâ€™s Pix is based on) and GNOMEâ€™s Photos are included."

gedit as the default program for webpresent files? they should be considered text files

BUG ---->
firefox/updater.ini
mkdir: cannot create directory â€˜/usr/lib/floflisâ€™: File exists
sending incremental file list
<---- BUG
-
Firedoge: detect if ~/.mozilla exist; if not, create a full profile as skip some steps!

Firedoge didn't even open:
sent 195,226 bytes  received 305 bytes  391,062.00 bytes/sec
total size is 193,918  speedup is 0.99
- Installing Firedoge in /usr/bin...
- Turning Firedoge into a executable...
Creating settings profile...
[i] Its normal that your browser opens and closes.
Running Nightly as root in a regular user's session is not supported.  ($XAUTHORITY is /home/floflis/.Xauthority which is owned by floflis.)
Installation didn't succeed. Try opening Firedoge icon and re-installing it.
What happened: Firedoge settings profile wasn't been created
(sorry but it isn't a helpful error message; BTW it will be improved <3)

"Account Details" not opening

add the blend package manager from BlendOS

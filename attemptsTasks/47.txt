- Cubic pjs folder
- Full, Basic (w/o WINE) and Lite versions
- generate build number automatically (year, month, add number)
- flic.conf: src ISOs, etc
- Automate DNA "config", cubic.conf and desktop watermark
- export folders, with all of the builds/attempts
- run "cubic --verbose", then export to build folder's cubic.html
- support to Snap seeding!
- support to generate the latest kernel, signed!
- support to Floflis forks such as UniOS

firstlogon edge question: install edge from ms repo instead of from deb
sudo apt install microsoft-edge-stable, https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge/
?, https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/ms-teams/
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/release

don't anymore run npm install on floapps (test if Central still work)
- dock/undock: install floapps also at Cubic side, then on next build attempt don't install on firstlogon anymore. with that, test if Floflis Central with NodeJS can come with the ISO (which is the ideal)
- upgrade floapps Node template + AppPlayer to the latest version possible

firstlogon install Weather, Maps, KeePassXC
don't install GIMP, Inkscape, remmina, VLC; prepare these for a user personality pack which will be asked on firstlogon also for IT technician
don't install hexchat from ISO

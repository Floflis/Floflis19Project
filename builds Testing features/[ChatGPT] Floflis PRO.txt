"I need some suggestions.

I will launch the paid Floflis PRO plan, which will include an NFT'ed physical media box.

This PRO plan will include the BlueGenie personal assistant that will use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

What else should Floflis PRO plan offer?"

Here are a few suggestions for what you could include in the Floflis PRO plan:

1. Access to premium support: Customers who subscribe to the PRO plan could have access to a dedicated support team that can help them with any issues they encounter while using Floflis.

2. Advanced customization options: Give PRO plan subscribers the ability to customize their desktops, including themes, widgets, and icons.

3. Early access to updates: PRO plan subscribers could get early access to new features and updates before they are released to the general public.

4. Cloud backup: Offer PRO plan subscribers the ability to back up their files to the cloud, so they don't have to worry about losing their data in case of a hardware failure.

5. Security features: Include advanced security features such as encrypted storage, antivirus protection, and two-factor authentication for PRO plan subscribers.

6. Free access to premium apps: Give PRO plan subscribers free access to premium apps, such as productivity software, graphics tools, or video editing programs.

7. Exclusive community: Create an exclusive community for PRO plan subscribers where they can connect with each other, share tips, and collaborate on projects.

8. Special discounts: Offer PRO plan subscribers special discounts on other Floflis products or services, as well as discounts on third-party products and services.

"To make things easier to manage on my side, I should offer Floflis PRO as a woocommerce item so it will be registered on Plasmmer's servers.

Floflis will have the UniStore, which will offer users NFT'ed desktop backgrounds and avatars.

It will use Frame as system-wide Wallet, IPFS Desktop and incentivize to use Aragon to find jobs or build a business.

I need more suggestions for the Floflis ecosystem, and for Floflis PRO as well (such as the monthly price for such plan)"

Here are some additional suggestions for the Floflis ecosystem and Floflis PRO:

1. Consider offering a decentralized social media platform that integrates with the Web3 ecosystem. Users could earn tokens for creating content or engaging with others on the platform, and those tokens could be used to purchase other items in the UniStore.

2. Another option for Floflis PRO could be access to exclusive content or tutorials on Rust and Web3 development. This could be a valuable resource for developers who are just starting to explore these technologies.

3. To incentivize early adoption of Floflis, consider offering a discount or promotional pricing for the first few months of the PRO plan.

4. You could also explore partnerships with other Web3 projects to create a more robust ecosystem. For example, you could partner with a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to offer users the ability to earn interest on their digital assets.

5. Consider hosting regular webinars or events for the Floflis community. These could be focused on topics related to Rust and Web3 development, or could be more general networking opportunities.

6. As for the price of the Floflis PRO plan, you may want to consider doing some market research to determine what users would be willing to pay for the features and benefits you are offering. You could also consider offering tiered pricing based on the length of the subscription (e.g. monthly vs. annual).

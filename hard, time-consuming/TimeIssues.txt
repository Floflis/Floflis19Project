Floflis tool for Windows time: Floflis stores when Floflis got connected to the Internet and its time/date changed, and identify when Windows has started and still offline. This tool will serve to not permit Windows messing up with time/date as its different from Linux. Windows is offline and its date/time is different of Linux, then when it goes online and changes date/time, and restarts to Linux and it also started offline: revert.

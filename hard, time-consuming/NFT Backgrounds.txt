Internal testing: current non-Floflis art NFTs as backgrounds (accept Foundation)

-? NFT backgrounds. Applying a background is saved on smart-contract state and Floflis srv

Backgrounds as NFTs
/media/daniell/B/git/Floflis/Floflis-DNA/layers/soil/include/img/nftbg

Floflis Backgrounds contract:
- ERC-1155
- URI uses ENS+IPFS
- Use "ERC1155PresetMinterPauser" (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/presets#ERC1155PresetMinterPauser - this also implements the "AccessControl" module - https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/access#AccessControl), so a centralized admin address is responsible for minting new backgrounds (new tokens with their own IDs onchain and URIs offchain) before this address grants to a DAO. This centralized address will be located at UniStore's server.
- Tests on Polygon testnet
- If multiple tests results ok, then: modify contract to be Upgradeable https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable (again, owner address should have the ability to later transfer ownership to an other address - DAO)
- Probably useful resource: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/extending-contracts
- Tests on Polygon testnet
- If multiple tests results ok, then: implement function for multiple creators as Rrible did. https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/staking-erc721-erc1155/ "A minted token is associated with one or multiple creators, namely the addresses that signed the minting data. Each creator of a token owns a share of it. The shares of a token need to add up to 10000, which represents 100% with 2 decimal places of precision."
- Can only mint Floflis Backgrounds using FLOF token

- how it will work
NFT factory - so all NFTs will be owned by their authors but the collection is Floflis Backgrounds
UniStore calls contract to mint, communicating directly to Frame
